            <p>I am Software Engineer with experience in web development.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I enjoy learning, be it new technologies, tools I can use in what I do, or even a new approach to a familiar problem.
                 For example,
                  React was used in the development of this site as well as hosting and route optimization with AWS as a way to help me learn.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I am always open to a new project that will help further my knowledge.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Currently I am working as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Buxton Co in Fort Worth, Texas.
